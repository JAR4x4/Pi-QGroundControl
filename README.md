# Pi-QGroundControl
QGroundControl for Raspberry Pi

The goal of this project is to compile QGroundControl (http://qgroundcontrol.com/) on a Raspberry Pi with latest Raspbian 2018-11-13.
The output will be a bash script which can automatize all the building process.

Running QGC on a Pi with a 7" touchscreen would be a very good mobile alternative to android or windows versions running on tablets, because linux version has very low latency with video streams.
